# Docker Prometheus with ecs_sd config

This container has only a small config file. It´s supposed to create an AWS ECS SD config
It´s an extension to the standard *[prom/prometheus](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/)* Docker image.

Inspired by [tkgregory´s ecs_sd remote config](https://github.com/tkgregory/prometheus-with-remote-configuration) \
only as a local version

Everything else remains the same.
